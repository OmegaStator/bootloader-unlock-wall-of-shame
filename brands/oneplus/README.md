# OnePlus

* Verdict **‚ÑπÔ∏è "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* [**üîìÔ∏è Unlock Guide**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)

All of OnePlus' phones are easily unlockable. 
However, do tread with caution as OPPO and OnePlus have merged their codebases into a "unified codebase", so OnePlus can, at any time, disable their unlocks.
This means OnePlus, at any time, can **completely pull an OPPO** and lock their unlock process.

OnePlus also used to provide Deep Testing for their SIM-locked devices in the US, however they have stopped doing this.

Please note that with the arrival of ColorOS16.0, [chinese users will require filling an application to unlock the bootloader](https://bbs.oneplus.com/thread/1926504022886318086) (just like with Xiaomi phones). It is probably due to local laws and will hopefully never be the same for other countries
